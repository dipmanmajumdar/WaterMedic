Visualize water intake over the last 7 days, 30 days, or 365 days using an interactive D3.js graph.
Hover over data points to view exact intake amounts.
Green dots indicate days meeting or exceeding the target; blue dots indicate otherwise.


### Responsive Design:

Optimized for desktop and mobile devices with a clean, modern UI.
Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive layouts and a neumorphic design for a sleek, glass-like aesthetic.
